How to download this map: 

Click on the green button that says "Code".

Unzip the file called "map", which is inside the main folder. 
Remove the "-main" from the file name. 
Place the file in your downloadedMaps folder. It should now show up when you click on "Select game" after having booted up TripleA.

If you follow these steps, the map should show up when you click on "Select game" after having booted up TripleA.
